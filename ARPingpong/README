OpenCV2.2 Usage explain
=======================

Here is a instruction for a extreme simple opencv 2.2 usage in this project 

Prerequisition:
For all project, this should be compiled at Visual Studio 2010

For the TemplateProject, it was worked with OpenCV 2.2 in Win32 mode, therefore, it requires OpenCV 2.2 
1. Please download it from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.2/

2. Then, please set up OPENCV_DIR for you OpenCV installation directory, the directory should contains bin and include folders,
	for example D:\Dropbox\OtherPrograms\CV\OpenCV2.2
	To do this please run the command below:

	setx -m OPENCV_DIR D:\Dropbox\OtherPrograms\CV\OpenCV2.2

3. To run your program with OpenCV, please add <opencv_dir>\bin to your PATH env_variable

3. If you need, please check whether you have had added the dependencies for OpenCV modules, it looks like
	opencv_(Module name)(Version Number)d.lib  (d means libraries used for debug, for release version use non-d lib)
	and here is the total debug list for 2.2

	opencv_core220d.lib
	opencv_imgproc220d.lib
	opencv_highgui220d.lib
	opencv_ml220d.lib
	opencv_video220d.lib
	opencv_features2d220d.lib
	opencv_calib3d220d.lib
	opencv_objdetect220d.lib
	opencv_contrib220d.lib
	opencv_legacy220d.lib
	opencv_flann220d.lib

	here is the total release list for 2.2

	opencv_core220.lib
	opencv_imgproc220.lib
	opencv_highgui220.lib
	opencv_ml220.lib
	opencv_video220.lib
	opencv_features2d220.lib
	opencv_calib3d220.lib
	opencv_objdetect220.lib
	opencv_contrib220.lib
	opencv_legacy220.lib
	opencv_flann220.lib
